                <p>Official title - same duties as mentioned before albeit regularly included in main projects, new product launches discussions and document adaptations.</p>
                <p>Whilst I don't consider myself as a developer/expert further works in JavaScript using GQL schema, VsCode, GitHub and AI was accomplished in order to streamline our work and aid other teams in modifying/copying configs across different environments as well as manipulating data to be more efficient and deliver faster results <em>(ex. cutting configuration tasks from 4 hours to less than 30 minutes, migrating full configuration setups from one environment to another in a 2 hour 4 man team operation)</em>.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>daily optional morning calls to discuss any potential issues encountered (which can be auto requested through slack bot)</li>
                    <li>weekly team calls discussing internal improvement tickets (think of this as a show 'n' tell approach)</li>
                    <li>weekly 1-to-1</li>
                    <li>reporting to manager on a weekly basis</li>
                    <li>working closely with Product Owners (experimenting with features and trying things out first hand), Devs (offloading them from having to discuss directly with partners themselves by onboarding their knowledge and documenting for repeated process), C-level (strategising yearly roadmaps, assisting in pilot products, brainstorm on what functions we can onboard from other teams), Technical Writer (providing hands on info when it comes to putting words into practice)</li>

                <p>Here we aim to onboard new partners swiftly by guiding them through refined processes. My first task was to create and upkeep a standard on how partner projects are structured. This then paved the way for teams to organize their work by giving Project Managers a clear and easy to follow road map of what's needed.</p>
                <p>This process was then expanded to: adding internal and external documentation (including written and video), further understanding of our products, building Postman library (that gives anyone the ability to explore our GQL schema under 5 minutes), providing knowledge to my team and be the go to person when it comes to brand configurations, altered processes to mitigate existing/new/potential partners whilst still maintaining structure, created scripts to facilitate Integration team and help cut configuration, JIRA creation and upkeep workflows specifically for each of the 20+ Issue Types, maintaining internal and external knowledge bases, constant collaboration with teams especially Project Management, motivating and creating a framework for my team to keep improving on documentation, handing over of tasks once brand reaches Go Live status.</p>
